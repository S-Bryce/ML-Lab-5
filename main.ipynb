    "###\tPreparation (4 points total)\n",
    "\n",
    "\t[1 points] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). \n",
    "\t[1 points] Identify groups of features in your data that should be combined into cross-product features. Provide justification for why these features should be crossed (or why some features should not be crossed). \n",
    "\t[1 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",
    "\t[1 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Argue why your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n",
    "###\tModeling (5 points total)\n",
    "\t[2 points] Create at least three combined wide and deep networks to classify your data using Keras. Visualize the performance of the network on the training data and validation data in the same plot versus the training iterations. Note: use the \"history\" return parameter that is part of Keras \"fit\" function to easily access this data.\n",
    "\t[2 points] Investigate generalization performance by altering the number of layers in the deep branch of the network. Try at least two different number of layers. Use the method of cross validation and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab to select the number of layers that performs superiorly. \n",
    "\t[1 points] Compare the performance of your best wide and deep network to a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Alternatively, you can compare to a network without the wide branch (i.e., just the deep network). .  \n",
    "\n",
    "###\tExceptional Work (1 points total) \n",
    "o\t(0.4) The overall quality of the report as a coherent, useful, complete and polished product will be reflected here. Did you support your reasons for creating cross categories? Did you include plots and provide interpretation? Did you justify your choice of metrics?\n",
    "o\t(0.6) Additional analysis\n",
    "o\t(5000 level) You have free rein to provide any additional analyses and visualizations appropriate to your data.  Implement additional optimization models or statistical analysis.\n",
    "###\t( 7000 level students - options): \n",
    "\tCapture the embedding weights from the deep network and (if needed) perform dimensionality reduction on the output of these embedding layers (only if needed). That is, pass the observations into the network, save the embedded weights (called embeddings), and then perform  dimensionality reduction in order to visualize results. Visualize and explain any clusters in the data.\n",
    "\tUse statistical methods to compare the performance of different models.  For classification tasks, you ight compare using the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve. For regression tasks, you might use use Bland-Altman plots and residual variance calculations\n"
